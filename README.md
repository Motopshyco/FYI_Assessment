- Terms of Service Page Displays "Â©2024 FYI.FYI, Inc." at the Bottom
- Hamburger Menu Contains Correct User Selection Options
- Contact Support Button Redirects User to the Submit Request Page

To execute the scenarios with test script you will need:

- Python: install python in your pc
- If you are in a venv use "deactivate"
- Create a new venv using "python -m venv env_name" and activate it using ".\env_name\Scripts\activate"
- Copy the chromedriver in ".venv\Scripts"
- Selenium: run the command "pip install selenium"

Now you can run the tests executing the command "python -m unittest tests_scripts/fyi_tests.py" in your console or using
the run option in your IDE

- Python: install python in your pc
- Selenium: run the command "pip install selenium"
- Gherkin plugin in your IDE
- Behave: run the command "pip install behave selenium"

this reports you will need:

- Java: install java in your pc and configure the JAVA_HOME environment variable
- Allure: run the command "pip install allure-behave"
- Allure CLI: download the allure-framework in your pc and the path of the bin folder in your Path environment variable
- Execute the scenarios using "behave -f allure_behave.formatter:AllureFormatter -o allure-results"
- Generate the report using "allure generate allure-results -o allure-report --clean"
- Open the report using "allure open allure-report"

Using this steps you can see the report and check the screenshots if something fails in the execution
